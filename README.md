As seen in the data, the charter schools differ by having on average better math scores in the lower-classmen (9th grade, 10th grade)and higher reading scores in the upper-classmen(11th, 12th) scores in the while the public schools differ by higher reading scores, slightly. When using a dataframe per school and coing the average scores per funding, we see that the lower funded schools do worst
